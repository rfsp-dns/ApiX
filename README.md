<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About 

### What APIX stands ? 

It's was supposed to be a better version for API Keys, but i like the name so i use it anyways.

### How can i use it ?

Just download the library, use it freely, and make the world more secure.

### Can i modify ?

You can modify the program and make it more efficient, secure and improved.

### I downloaded but i don't know how to start !

You need to provide the library two files with differente extensions :
- `encripted-content.enc`
- `source-for-encrypt.aenc`

After having these two file you need to put the files on this way :
- `/api/encripted-content.enc`
- `/encode/source-for-encrypt.aenc`

**The library read the file in that specific directory so this should be in this way :**
```
|-- your-project
|   |-- project.py
|   |-- libraries
|   |   |-- apix.py
|   |   |   |-- encode
|   |   |   |   |-- source-for-encrypt.aenc
|   |   |   |-- api
|   |   |   |   |-- encripted-content.enc
|
```



### Why you use the extensions `.aenc` and `.enc` ?

`.aenc` is for the file that provides the encrypted caracters, this extention symbolizes `.alternativeencryption`.

`.enc` is for the file that has the encrypted content, this extions symbolizes `.encrypted`.
